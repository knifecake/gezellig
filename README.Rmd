# Gezellig - A UI toolkit that complements R Shiny

## Installation

`gezellig` is only available on GitHub so the `devtools` package is required to install it. If you do not have it installed (or you are not sure if you have it) install it from CRAN with the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once you have `devtools`, the `gezellig` package can be installed with
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("knifecake/gezellig")
```


## UI Modules

### Tabular data loader

### Table inputs
